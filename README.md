# Maplestory Link and Legion table

Creating a website to look through all maplestory (GMS) characters and what their link skills and legion effects are.

First milestone will be to have a table map out all the characters and be able to sort by different parameters such as alphabetical order

Second milestone will be to allow users to save this application and be able to save and update their progress on all the characters and offer a place to track who they should work on next
